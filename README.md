## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Limitations

1. The draw of tickets periodically and continuously at every x minutes depends on the frontend api call. As this system is developed in laravel, it is hard to handle process that are needed to be called repeatedly and periodically. Scheduler in Laravel is needed to implement these repeated functions, which requires to run as a cron job. Due to cron job requires modifying the cron file in the local drive, it might not be a good solution for this system. Therefore, the ticket drawing event depends on the api request from the frontend. Frontend is required to call that api repeatedly with the given interval to start each draw.
2. After each draw, the backend response with the win ticket details and the draw details. Each contestent frontend need to call apis to get the updated information of their tickets instead of getting whether they win or not directly. Frequently calls of api for getting tickets information may needed. Websocket may be a better solution to this kind of situation.  
3. Under the situation of not knowing what actually needs to be display on the client side, methods defined in controllers are mostly generalized methods, so as to suit different combination of data that the client side needed. If how data needed to be displayed in client side is knowable, more precise methods could be developed to prevent getting extra data from the database thus reduce the complexity of the data response to the frontend.
